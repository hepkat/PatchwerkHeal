# patchwerkheal (wow classic)
Patchwerk Heal addon - Makes Patchwerk healing braindead easy.

A dude named Beemo uploaded this to curseforge. Then he took it down. The description he had on curseforge:
```
Addon for Patchwerk for healers. 

1. Enable the addon (this is disabled by default when you install) Enabled by default now
2. Select your assigned heal target.
3. Drag the correct spell to the the box
4. Spam click the button

Not much else to say... This was original[sic] made to help Beemo avoid repair bills.

credit to Zeg, 狗月, 一只傻安安 for making the original chinese version. I modified it to work with the US version on classic wow
```
Ignore step 1. This addon is enabled by default now.

Don't ask me to update this addon or the intricacies of its dependency state. I didn't make it. I didn't modify it. I'm just posting it here. Fork it if you want idgaf.
