Patchwerk Heal addon - Makes Patchwerk healing braindead easy.

A dude named Beemo uploaded this to curseforge. Then he took it down. The description he had on curseforge:
```Addon for Patchwerk for healers. 

 

1. Enable the addon (this is disabled by default when you install)

2. Select your assigned heal target.

3. Drag the correct spell to the the box

4. Spam click the button

 

Not much else to say... This was original made to help Beemo avoid repair bills.

Don't ask me to update this addon or the intricacies of its dependency state. I didn't make it. I didn't modify it. I'm just posting it here. Fork it if you want idgaf.
